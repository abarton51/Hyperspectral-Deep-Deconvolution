# Hyperspectral Deep Deconvolution
CS 4644 Deep Learning at Georgia Tech Course Project

## Overview
This project addresses the challenge of chromatic aberration in snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Our proposed method aims to enhance the quality of hyperspectral images by mitigating distortions inherent in snapshot acquisitions by leveraging a blind deconvolution approach with a U-Net neural network architecture. This allows real-time correction without the need for complex scanning mechanisms nor knowledge of point spread functions. Through experimental validation, we demonstrated the efficacy of our method in preserving image structure and chemical composition information contributing to improved imaging throughput and simplified hardware requirements. Our paper represents a simple yet effective approach to circumventing blurring issues and spectral information retrieval in snapshot hyperspectral imaging, providing a practical solution for applications in medical imaging, agriculture, materials identification, and geological surveillance.
